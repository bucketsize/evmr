Intro:
======
A map-reduce framework written in ruby.

The motivation was to use fast network IO lib called EventMachice for map-reduce just as a POC.

Have Mappers and Reducers scheduled work packets, an intermedeate merge is hidden and resides with the scheduler.

TODO:
====
Scheduler can be a reducer.
Merge can also be a reducer.
Have multiple fault-tolerent scheduler/mergers.
Use a distributed cache to hold intermediate work packets.
